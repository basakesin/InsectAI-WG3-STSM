# How to Deploy Your Trained Model on Hugging Face

This repository provides a practical, step-by-step guide for deploying trained machine learning models on **Hugging Face**.  
Within the InsectAI COST Action, our aim is to make AI-based insect monitoring tools accessible not only to computer scientists but also to zoologists, ecologists, and other researchers.

We present **two different paths** for deploying models:

- **Path 1:** Train your model in Google Colab and deploy on Hugging Face Spaces (See the documentation for [Keras](https://github.com/basakesin/InsectAI-WG3-STSM/tree/main/Hugging_Face_Spaces_Demo/Hugging_Face_Spaces_for_Keras) and [PyTorch](https://github.com/basakesin/InsectAI-WG3-STSM/tree/main/Hugging_Face_Spaces_Demo/Hugging_Face_Spaces_for_PyThorch)) 
- **Path 2:** Use Hugging Face AutoTrain to train and deploy directly on Spaces ([see the instructions here](https://github.com/basakesin/InsectAI-WG3-STSM/tree/main/Hugging_Face_Spaces_Demo/Hugging_Face_Spaces_for_Autotrain))
